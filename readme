## 🛠️ For lazy image 
The loading="lazy" attribute is used in an <img> tag to delay loading the image until it comes into view on the screen. This improves page speed and performance, especially when you have many images.


<img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/images/icon12.png" alt="Description" loading="lazy">
